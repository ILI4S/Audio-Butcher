DESCRIPTION:

Audio Butcher is a minimal, real-time audio sampling and sequencing application that turns your laptop into a music production center.

Use it to carve any audio output and serve premium cuts of audio samples. An unfathomable variety of sounds are already accesible on your iTunes, on YouTube, and other computer applications for your remixing pleasure.

FileWrite: creating WAV file: temp/N.wav


FileWrite: creating WAV file: temp/O.wav


INSTALL:

Audio Butcher compiles on Mac OS X 10.6.4. No clue if it compiles on anything else. On Mac OS X either download the binary or run make on the source and run the resulting executable from the command line (see further instructions).

Audio Butcher requires Soundflower to reroute your audio output to Audio Butcher. After installing Soundflower from http://cycling74.com/products/soundflower/ set your audio output to Soundflower (2ch) and run Audio Butcher with the appropriate channel settings. (Channels are listed in Terminal when Audio Butcher is run).
