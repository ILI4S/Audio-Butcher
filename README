DESCRIPTION:

Audio Butcher is a real-time audio sampling and sequencing application that is minimal and keyboard-based. 


INSTALL:

Audio Butcher compiles on Mac OS X 10.6.4. No clue if it compiles on anything else. Try it for yourself! On Mac OS X just run make on the source and run the resulting executable from the command line (see instructions on command line usage below).


DEPENDENCIES:

soundflower
libsndfile


COMMAND LINE USAGE:

./butcher

OR 

./butcher --in INPUT_DEVICE --out OUTPUT_DEVICE RECIPE_DIRECTORY
ex: ./butcher --in 5 --out 3 my_recipe


COMMANDS:

Input is 99% keyboard based.
All commands ARE case sensitive.

	A-Z		Record / cut audio buffers 
	a-z		Playback / serve audio buffers 
	1-0		Play with sound effects
	esc		Cancel and save to /temp					TODO
	esc esc	Exit	

	_		Load recipe to audio buffers.
	+		Save recipe to harddisk

Follow these commands with any buffer key ( a-z ):

	` 		Display spectrogram of audio buffer on cutting board
	~		Save cutting board audio buffer to key
	del 	Delete that audio buffer
	enter	Play sample once and then stop (no looping) TODO

Cutting board controls:

	del 		Delete to the left of the marker
	alt del		Delete to the right of the marker

	+			Increase gain							
	=			Decrease gain							

	_			Increase pitch							TODO
	-			Decrease pitch							TODO

	alt -		Reload audio files						REMAP
	alt =		Save audio buffers to files				REMAP

	[			Shorten start (left)
	]			Pad start (left)

	{			Shorten end (right)
	}			Pad end (right)

	alt + [		Clip left of cursor
	alt + ]		Clip right of cursor

	alt		Roll a loop by holding down while playing back audio buffers	
			The resulting buffer is mapped to the cutting board.


DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP:

	1) Pitch shifting (tried STK.. )
	
	Effects
	Scratching
	Keyboard graphics?


MISC TODO:

	Delete should take a cut off the board
